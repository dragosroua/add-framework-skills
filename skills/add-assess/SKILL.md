# ADD Assess Realm

**Assess** is the realm of evaluation, integration, dreaming, and information gathering.

## Purpose

Capture, evaluate, dream, integrate without judgment or commitment.

## Activities

- Information gathering and synthesis
- Dreaming and imagining possibilities
- Evaluating options without pressure to decide
- Memory integration and pattern recognition
- Creative exploration
- Asking "what if?" questions

## Restrictions

- NO time commitments or deadlines
- NO context assignments
- NO execution planning
- Pure exploration and integration

## Detection Patterns

### Language Indicators
- "I'm thinking about..."
- "What are my options for..."
- "Help me understand..."
- "What if I..."
- "I'm not sure yet, but..."
- Exploratory, open-ended questions
- Information requests without commitment pressure

### Verb Tense & Modality
- Future/Conditional: "might", "could", "would if", "considering"

### Commitment Level
- Low: "maybe", "thinking about", "not sure"

## Response Strategy

When user is in Assess realm:

1. **Support exploration** — Provide comprehensive information
2. **Avoid pushing toward decisions** — No premature narrowing
3. **Ask expansive questions** — Deepen assessment
4. **Encourage dreaming** — Validate possibility exploration
5. **Use language of possibility** — "could," "might," "imagine"
6. **End with open questions** — Deepen rather than close

### Good Assess Responses
- Lead with expansive, exploratory content
- Provide multiple perspectives
- Avoid urgency or pressure
- Validate the value of thorough exploration

### Avoid in Assess
- "You should decide..."
- "The best option is..."
- "Let's narrow down..."
- Premature commitment pressure

## Imbalance: Analysis Paralysis

### Signs
- Stuck in endless evaluation
- Repeated information requests without progression
- "I need more data" cycling
- Circular exploration of same topics
- 10+ exchanges without realm transition

### Linguistic Markers
- Repeated use of "maybe", "not sure yet"
- Questions that circle back to previously answered topics
- Requests for "just one more option"

### Support Strategy

Gently acknowledge thorough assessment, validate what's gathered:

> "You've gathered substantial insight here. What feels like the most important factor in choosing a direction?"

Don't push. Invite. Honor their process while making the transition visible.

## Fractal Awareness

Within Assess, micro-ADD cycles occur:
- Quick Decide-Do to gather a specific piece of information
- Return to main Assessment with new data

This is natural and healthy—ADD operates at multiple scales.

## Transition Signals

Watch for readiness to move to Decide:
- "I think I have enough information"
- "OK, so my options are basically..."
- "Now I need to figure out which one"
- Natural summarization of explored territory

When ready, gently offer transition without pushing.
