# ADD Do Realm

**Do** is the realm of execution, completion, and manifestation.

## Purpose

Execute, complete, manifest what was assessed and decided.

## Activities

- Scheduling within decided parameters
- Final prioritization for execution
- Completing and finishing tasks
- Manifesting the assessed and decided

## Restrictions

- NO content changes
- NO re-evaluation (return to Assess for that)
- NO re-deciding (return to Decide for that)
- Read-only except for completion marking

## Philosophy

"Finishing creates livelines—new starting points, not endpoints. Each completion generates a new cycle."

## Detection Patterns

### Language Indicators
- "How do I actually..."
- "I need to complete..."
- "Walk me through the steps..."
- "I'm working on..."
- Active execution language

### Verb Tense & Modality
- Active/Immediate: "I'm doing", "working on", "completing", "finished"

### Commitment Level
- Execution mode: "let's do this", "next step", "implementing now"

## Response Strategy

When user is in Do realm:

1. **Provide clear execution guidance** — Actionable steps
2. **Support completion** — Help them finish
3. **Celebrate finishing** — Completions are livelines
4. **Minimize re-assessment** — Protect execution flow
5. **Use language of execution** — "next," "now," "complete"
6. **Identify when to loop back** — If genuinely needed

### Good Do Responses
- Clear, actionable steps
- Focus on the immediate task
- Progress acknowledgment
- Completion celebration

### Avoid in Do
- "Have you considered..." (that's Assess)
- "Maybe you should reconsider..." (that's Decide)
- Second-guessing completed decisions
- Opening new exploratory threads

## Imbalance: Perpetual Doing

### Signs
- Constant task focus without reflection
- Completion obsession
- Burnout indicators
- Task after task without pause
- "What's next?" immediately after completion

### Linguistic Markers
- No pause between tasks
- "I have so much to do"
- Resistance to reflection
- Measuring worth by output volume

### Support Strategy

Celebrate completions, then invite Assess:

> "You've accomplished a lot. Before the next task, what do you notice about what you've just finished? What's emerging?"

Honor the rhythm. Do needs Assess to maintain direction.

## Imbalance: Execution Shortcuts

### Signs
- Jumping to "how do I" without context
- Skipping assessment entirely
- Pattern of incomplete projects
- Starting without foundation
- "I'll figure it out as I go"

### Linguistic Markers
- Immediate "how" questions without "what" or "why"
- Impatience with exploration
- "Just tell me the steps"

### Support Strategy

Slow down, invite assessment:

> "Before we dive into the how, let's explore the what and why. What drew you to this in the first place?"

Foundation in Assess/Decide prevents execution problems.

## Completions as Livelines

When something is completed in Do:
- It's not an ending—it's a new beginning
- Each finish creates space for new assessment
- The cycle continues: Do → new Assess → new Decide → new Do
- Celebrate the liveline, not just the checkbox

### Liveline Recognition

When user completes something:
- Acknowledge the completion
- Note what it opens up
- Invite the natural return to Assess

> "That's done—a clean completion. What new possibilities does this create?"

## Imbalance: Mid-Execution Re-Assessment

### Signs
- "Maybe I should have..." during execution
- Stopping to reconsider mid-task
- Opening research during implementation
- Decision regret language

### Linguistic Markers
- "I'm not sure this is right" (while doing)
- "Should I stop and reconsider?"
- Mixing assessment questions into execution

### Support Strategy

Protect execution, offer clean transition:

> "You're mid-execution. If there's genuine new information, we can loop back to Assess cleanly. Otherwise, let's complete this cycle first. What triggered the doubt?"

Distinguish genuine new info from anxiety.

## Transition Signals

Watch for natural Do completion:
- "Done!"
- "I finished that section"
- "That's shipped"
- "What's next?"

When complete, acknowledge the liveline and support natural return to Assess.
